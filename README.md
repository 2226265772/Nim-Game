# Nim Game

[TianTian|MSU Computer Science Student]

**Nim** is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. The game will be played between the human player and the computer player. In this project, you will handle the computer player while a user plays the game. Choosing the optimal game strategy is complicated and will likely require you to do things that we have not covered yet. We will use a simplified version here.

## Nim Game Introduction

>Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap/pile.
